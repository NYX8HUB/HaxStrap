# HWID Spoofer (Built-in Module)

A lightweight, session-based **HWID spoofer module** designed for integration into Windows applications or development tools. It modifies system identifiers in-memory or temporarily for use in testing, privacy protection, or backend validation bypass scenarios (e.g., licensing, tracking, QA environments).

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 **Built-in integration** – Easily embeddable into existing applications or test frameworks.
- 🔒 **Non-persistent spoofing** – All changes revert after system restart.
- 💻 **Spoofs common hardware IDs**:
  - Volume Serial Numbers
  - MAC Addresses
  - BIOS Serial / UUID
  - Machine GUID (registry)
- ⚙️ **Customizable** – Select specific identifiers to spoof.

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Testing software behavior under varying system identities.
- Bypassing IP/HWID-based rate limits during QA.
- Simulating new device environments in CI pipelines.
- Temporary identity masking for user/device simulations.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is intended for **development and testing purposes only**. Use in production systems should follow applicable software and legal guidelines. Always test in virtual or sandboxed environments to ensure stability.
